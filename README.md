# Candy Fluffs

Candy Fluffs is an eCommerce website for illustrator Candy Joy, designed with love in Figma and powered by modern web technologies. Originally built with Gatsby, the project was overhauled and migrated to Next.js and TypeScript, improving performance and maintainability. It integrates DatoCMS, Snipcart, Stripe, and Mailchimp to provide a seamless shopping experience.

## Project Evolution

The original version was created in 2021 using Gatsby by a team of three:
- **[Doug](https://github.com/daleinen7)**: Lead Developer
- **[Stephanie](https://github.com/mlisdev)**: Front-end Developer
- **[Brittney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittneygalloway/)**: Designer and Maintenance Developer

Since then, Brittney became the sole maintainer and led the migration to Next.js and TypeScript for better scalability and developer experience.
